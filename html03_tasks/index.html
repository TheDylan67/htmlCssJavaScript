            My name is Dylan Gilbert, and this is the home page of my personal website. 
            I'm currently focused on learning web development, starting with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. 
            I believe a strong foundation in these languages is needed for building websites.

            I am going to share my progress and interests with you. On this site, you can learn more about my background,
            what I'm currently studying, and how to get in touch with me.
