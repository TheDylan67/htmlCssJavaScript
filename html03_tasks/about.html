            <p>
                I am currently enrolled in a Software Engineering course, where I am learning  web development 
                concepts, including HTML, design, and Github. 
                My focus is on Learning all the coding terms and concepts to be able to apply it to later projects in the future.

            <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy working out, which helps me think smartly and stay active, and cooking, 
                which helps me keep an open mind to trying new things.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My primary long-term goal is to become some sort of sports medicine scientist and I am sure that software engineering will be able to make websites to farthur improve my career in the future.
