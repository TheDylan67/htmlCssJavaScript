                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main structure for any webpage. It gives meaning to your content. 
                Knowing how to use tags correctly is important for making websites accessible and good for search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Focus on using tags like "header", "main", "section", "article", and "footer" to keep your documents organized.

            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how a webpage looks, including its colors and layout. 
                You need to learn about the CSS Box Model and layout properties like Flexbox and Grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Responsive design** is a main idea. It means using special rules (media queries) to make sure your website 
                looks right on all screen sizes, from phones to desktops.

            <h2 id="javascript">JavaScript Resources</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is the language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. 
                It's used for everything from checking forms to building complex web apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern JavaScript includes newer features like arrow functions and promises, which are needed for current development.

            <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Every developer needs tools like a good code editor, a way to manage changes (**"Git/GitHub"**), 
                and the developer Tools built into your browser for finding errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning the command line will also help you work faster and deal with different setups.

            <h2 id="books">Books</h2>
            <p>
                Online resources are good, but books offer a more structured look at the main concepts. 
                Classic books on programming ideas are still useful for all developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make time for slower, deep study of basic topics to better understand how the web works.
