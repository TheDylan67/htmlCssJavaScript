            The red panda is one of the most fascinating and endangered animals in the world. 
            Native to the temperate forests of the Himalayas and southwestern China, these 
            charming creatures are known for their striking reddish-brown fur and bushy 
            ringed tails. The Akron Zoo is proud to be part of the conservation effort 
            to protect this incredible species through the Association of Zoos and 
            Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan.
