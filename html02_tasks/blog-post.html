            <h2>Week 2: Learning HTML Text Formatting</h2>
            <p>Posted on November 19, 2025</p>
            
            <p>This week, I've been diving deep into the fundamentals of **HTML**. It's been an eye-opening experience to learn how simple tags control the structure and presentation of content on the web. We focused heavily on *text formatting* and the importance of using the correct tag for the job.</p>
            
            <p>The concept of **semantic HTML** is what's really sticking with me. Instead of just making text bold with `<b>`, we're learning to use `<strong>` to indicate importance. Similarly, we use `<em>` instead of `<i>` for emphasis. This subtle difference is crucial for accessibility and search engine optimization.</p>
            
            <p>We also explored semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`. Organizing a webpage into these logical containers makes the code much cleaner and easier to understand for both developers and web browsers. It's a fundamental skill, and it will save so much time later on. <mark>Using the right tag is always better than just making it look right</mark>.</p>

            <p>I'm looking forward to the next lesson on hyperlinks and how to manage file paths, which will finally allow me to connect all my pages together¹.</p>
