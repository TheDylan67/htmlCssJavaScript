Version 1
I want you to make me a website about a restaurant where it is mostly healthy foods and protein with the home pages header, menu, about, services, contact, footer, in that specific order. The name of the restaurant is called primal. I want to style the website as well so I want it to have a earthy tone to it like green, brown, red, black or just things that gives it a natural earthy vibe to it. It will be a place where you can order food such as rice, red meat, poultry, basic sea food, carbs (potatoes, rice, pasta), and vegetables. Along with all those foods I would like to have a drink menu like the restaurant pulp, where they can make smoothies or shakes for you. I want there to also be a section where you are able to buy the meats yourself like a butcher shop where seasonings and sauces are sold. (use placeholder images till I can download them and put them in) I want the page layout  3-Column Grid and each image of each food is right next to eachother with the title of the food below it along with the price. Make the font times new roman with each image atleast a inch apart
Result: I did make the website correctly but there wasnt a three row column and some of the items I listed weren’t thre

Version 2
Can you add more food items I feel like its not enough I want white rice, chicken, turkey, and ground beef. Also I feel like everything is too expensive make it a bit more affordable and I was kind of hoping for an option to be able to do something like chipotle where you can make your own burrito and bowl with the ingredients on the menu. Also you didn’t make it the three grid column I was hoping it would be three items next to each other and then below another three items because I dont want to have to scroll down to see each individual item id like to see them layed out across my screen. Also I feel like there should be more variety in the seasonings.
Give it a settings option and I would like there to be a dark mode feature incase the screen is too bright for others
Result:I did make the three row grid but the prices did not change and mostly stayed the same

Version 3
it looks good can you just make sure the code is clean, works on mobile devices such as a ipad, or phone. and you didn't add the more variety of seasonings and suaces like I asked for
you just messed  up the order I wanted it in what happened to the three row thing I have been asking you for can you make sure to keep everything the same just format it the way I have been asking for whichi is rows of three displaying the food on the menu
Result: Switched up on me and put it on top of eachother and did the opposite of what I asked for and it is capable of working out mobile devices

Version 4
It still isnt in rows of three can you make it to where it would have a list of three meats across the screen and then another row of the next three I dont want it to all be on top of eachother one by one I want it layed out
Problem: it wasn’t sorted how I wanted it to be sorted
Result:The entire time it didn’t layout the three rows like I asked for
